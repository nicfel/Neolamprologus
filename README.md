# Analysis of the Neolamprologus data using AIM to infer the species tree jointly with gene flow

The analysis is based on sequence data from [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mec.13767](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mec.13767).  The analysis uses 100 randomly sampled loci.

The inferred species trees are plotted in /combined/. Arrows are shown for gene flow supported with a Bayes Factor of more than 10. Each log file thereby corresponds to one species tree figure. The different lenghts of the log files corresponding to ech figures are due to different support for these species trees. For the figures, we only used the 4 best supported trees.
