# Analysis of the Neolamprologus data using AIM to infer the species tree jointly with gene flow

The analysis is based on sequence data from [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mec.13767](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mec.13767).  The analysis uses 100 randomly sampled loci.

The best supported trees are  plotted in /combined/. Arrows are shown for gene flow supported with a Bayes Factor of more than 10.
