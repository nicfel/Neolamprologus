# Analysis of the Neolamprologus data using AIM to infer the species tree jointly with gene flow

The analysis is based on sequence data from [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mec.13767](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mec.13767).  The analysis uses 100 randomly sampled loci.

The inferred species trees are plotted in /combined/. Arrows are shown for gene flow supported with a Bayes Factor of more than 10. Each log file corresponds to one species tree with a unique ranked tree topology. The different lenghts of the log files  are due to different support for these species trees. For the figures, we only used the 4 best supported trees, i.e. tree files 1 to 4.
